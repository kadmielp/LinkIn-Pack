# Bookmark File Editor

Single-file HTML app for editing browser bookmark export files.

- No install
- No build step
- No upload
- Works by opening `index.html` in a browser

## What It Does

- Open exported bookmark `.html` / `.htm` files
- Add, edit, move, sort, and delete bookmarks
- Add and rename folders
- Search titles and URLs
- Export a browser-compatible bookmark HTML file

## How To Use

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Click **Open bookmark file**.
3. Choose a bookmark HTML file exported from your browser.
4. Edit the folders and URLs.
5. Click **Export HTML**.
6. Import the new file back into your browser.

## Project Management Onboarding Use Case

Project managers and team leads can use this to prepare a clean bookmark file for new joiners.

The goal is to give people one organized import with the tools they need on day one: CRM, project boards, design files, docs, reports, and internal processes.
